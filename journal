today we did a few challenges to review tracing algorithms, describing hardware, 
and did a fun game involving a bit of a scavenger hunt at the KAC computer.
I realized there are many different ways to approach problems, and that
Computer Science gives us a lot of interesting tools for approaching problem solving.

today we learned some basic comands to use in the terminal, including ls (list) cp (copy) and others.
we also did a short activity that involved creating, moving, and editing files in different directories. 
I learned that the terminal is a useful tool in understanding and operating a computer,
and allows one to view information stored on the computer more as data packages rather than apps or programs to run.

today we learned about different network topologies, types of networks, and IP addresses. 
we also practiced programming remotely via terminal to a raspberry pi using the commands we learned previously. 
this provided an example application of the networking concepts we learned as well as practicing our terminal 
command knowledge.

today we continued learning about different levels of networking, and practiced building webpages on raspberry pis.
I feel I still have more to learn about how data is shared remotely over networks, but I do understand the basics.

today we learned how to turn a raspberry pi into a vpn server, i know how vpns improve security and the simple commands needed to
create one on a rpi. in general i dont think this is the most useful thing though, since it can still be linked to a location
near your computer, and it can be difficult to successfully connect to.

today we continued working with a raspberry pi vpn, trying to connect our devices to the network. it was unsuccessful.
this was confusing because there were no apparent errors, it just refused to connect. hopefully we can explain ourselves
adequately next class.

we presented what we learned from working with VPN RPi. I still don't quite understand the utility of using a RPi as a VPN
without other filters, since the RPi will still point to your location if you are nearby. But I guess it is more of a start
to understanding the logic behind VPNs. I also discussed my IA with Dr. P and have a good plan going forward. 
I will be using a text-based rather than graphic-based display for the animal creation processes, so the app
will rely heavily on databases. I will create the appropriate flow charts and UML diagrams in the next three weeks, after
which point I can begin coding.
