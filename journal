journal entry: today we reviewed networks with an episode of the magic school bus. it was a fun way to recap, though obviously
the show was not particularly detailed. It made me realize I need to review packet switching and IP addresses. I'm still
struggling to work out how to use core data storage on iOS for my IA, but I am dedicating several days over break to finishing
the app, so I am sure I can get it done before our internal deadline.

to do: 

- IA
  - figure out core data storage
  - figure out daily reminders
  - figure out table display
  
  once coding is finished (OCT BREAK!) then finish all documentation!
