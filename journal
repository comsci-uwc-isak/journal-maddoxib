today we did a few challenges to review tracing algorithms, describing hardware, 
and did a fun game involving a bit of a scavenger hunt at the KAC computer.
I realized there are many different ways to approach problems, and that
Computer Science gives us a lot of interesting tools for approaching problem solving.

today we learned some basic comands to use in the terminal, including ls (list) cp (copy) and others.
we also did a short activity that involved creating, moving, and editing files in different directories. 
I learned that the terminal is a useful tool in understanding and operating a computer,
and allows one to view information stored on the computer more as data packages rather than apps or programs to run.

today we learned about different network topologies, types of networks, and IP addresses. 
we also practiced programming remotely via terminal to a raspberry pi using the commands we learned previously. 
this provided an example application of the networking concepts we learned as well as practicing our terminal 
command knowledge.

9-6
today we continued learning about different levels of networking, and practiced building webpages on raspberry pis.
I feel I still have more to learn about how data is shared remotely over networks, but I do understand the basics.
