today we learned some basic comands to use in the terminal, including ls (list) cp (copy) and others.
we also did a short activity that involved creating, moving, and editing files in different directories. 
I learned that the terminal is a useful tool in understanding and operating a computer,
and allows one to view information stored on the computer more as data packages rather than apps or programs to run.
